# Health-Monitoring-System-Using-IoT

Overview

In recent times, the prevalence of intelligent health monitoring systems has been steadily increasing, driven by a multitude of compelling factors. Firstly, the global population is on the rise, exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals. Secondly, situations such as Covid-19 has underscored the necessity for minimizing direct contact and maintaining social distancing. Thirdly, the potential to concurrently monitor multiple patients has emerged as a means to expedite responses and diminish the reliance on individualized healthcare attention.

At the heart of this endeavor lies the fundamental goal of conceptualizing and executing an IoT-based Smart Health Monitoring System. This system leverages advanced sensors—namely the MAX30102, MLX90614, and AD8232—which are strategically positioned on the patient's body to capture diverse physiological parameters encompassing pulse rate, ECG readings, and body temperature. These sensors establish a connection with control units, comprising the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, responsible for the real-time computation of sensor data. The resultant calculated values are then seamlessly transmitted and archived within the IoT cloud infrastructure, accessible from a central base station.

By harnessing the capabilities of IoT platforms, the collected data becomes effortlessly accessible from remote locations. This accessibility enables medical professionals to conduct diagnoses and assessments from a distance, profoundly enhancing the potential for timely intervention and medical decision-making.
