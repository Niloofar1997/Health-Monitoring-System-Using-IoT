# Health-Monitoring-System-Using-IoT

Overview
Nowadays, smart health monitoring systems are going to be popular more and more due to several reasons. First, growing population and the lack of enough healthcare workers. Second, the need for indirect contact and social distance due to the present Covid situation. Third, the possibility to monitor more than one patient at the same time, which leads to faster response and reducing the need for personal healthcare.
The core objective of this project is to design and implement a Smart Health Monitoring System based on IoT. The Sensors (MAX30102, MLX90614, and AD8232) are embedded on the patientâ€™s body to sense various parameters such as pulse rate, ECG and body temperature. These sensors are connected to the control units (Raspberry pi and Arduino), which calculate the values of the sensors. These values are stored in the IoT cloud service to the base station. By using the IoT platforms, the data can be accessed at any remote place. Therefore, the disease can be diagnosed by the doctor from a distanced location.
